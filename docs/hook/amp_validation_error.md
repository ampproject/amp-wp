## Filter `amp_validation_error`

```php
apply_filters( 'amp_validation_error', $error, $context );
```

Filters the validation error array.

This allows plugins to add amend additional properties which can help with more accurately identifying a validation error beyond the name of the parent node and the element&#039;s attributes. The $sources are also omitted because these are only available during an explicit validation request and so they are not suitable for plugins to vary sanitization by. If looking to force a validation error to be ignored, use the &#039;amp_validation_error_sanitized&#039; filter instead of attempting to return an empty value with this filter (as that is not supported).

### Arguments

* `array $error` - Validation error to be printed.
* `array $context` - {     Context data for validation error sanitization.     @type DOMNode $node Node for which the validation error is being reported. May be null. }
